# Variable exponent diffusion for image processing  
Demonstration code (MATLAB) for the one pass weighted p-Dirichlet energy minimization approach for the structure+texture (cartoon+texture) extraction method described in the following [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00138-023-01432-z). 

## Examples 
An example of use is shown in the file ```demo_struct.m```. It computes the structure and texture for a test image (provided in this repository). 

## Dependencies 
There is no particular dependency. 

## Reference 
The methods are described in the following [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00138-023-01432-z). The corresponding bibtex entry is
